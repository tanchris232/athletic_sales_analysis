# athletic_sales_analysis

## Notes

- My final work for this assignment is located in: M5_Starter_Code --> athletic_sales_analysis_starter_code.ipynb
- In this assignment we were asked to combine 2 data frames for athletic wear sales. Then show data using groupby's and pivot tables for units sold and total sales by region, units sold and total sales by retailer, and units sold and total sales for womens athletic footwear by retailer.
- Next we were asked to determine the day and week with the most womens athletic footwear sales using the resample method.
